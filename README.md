# MasterMind 
A codebreaking game for two! As a frequently played game in my childhood, Mastermind was the obvious choice for me to build with my newly developed and continutally evolving JS skills.  
  
Invented in the 70s by Mordecai Meirowitz, Mastermind was initially based on a paper-based game called Bulls and Cows. Immensely popular in its first decade, the game would sell over 30 million copies before eventually fading away to its lesser known status.

Though Mastermind is typically a two-player game, I will be making a one-player, one-computer version, where the player must guess the computer's randomly generated code. Will you find satisfaction in beating the bot? Or will your codebreaking attempts be thwarted?
